    The voice model is the voice of blucher.
    Because of the unique sound ray of the character,I even can't find extra  similarvoice audios from other characters made by the same voice actor.
    With the reason,up to now,the model hasn't been finished.
    Ummm,that's actually a disappointing fact that I may be unlikely to optimize the model,I can't get enough voice materials to remake the model as the voice feature is so special.
    Sorry to these blucher advocates,if you guys train the voice model and the effect is better than mine,I'm happy if you can pull request updating to the main brench!
    If you find more audios but have lacks on computer hardwares,welcome to post the audio package my emails!
